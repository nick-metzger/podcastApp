<title>Microscopes and Telescopes</title>
<description>Episode 98 goes to the Netherlands. There is something remarkable about the Dutch when it comes to glass lenses and scientific tools. Maybe Hans Lippershay invented the telescope. Maybe it was some kids in his town. Or maybe it was one of two other guys who seem to have come up with the idea at the same time and place. And as far as microscopes go, a dutch man named Antonie von Leeuwenhoek got obsessed with microscopes. He is remembered as the father of microbiology.</description>

<title>The Meatshower Part Two (Electric Burgoo)</title>
<description>In The Meatshower Part 2 (Electric Burgoo) the saga continues. Originally we aired a segment in 2019 to coincide with Mick's book "The Meatshower: The Mostly True Tale of an Odd and (Somewhat) Edible Occurrence," and since then, new information has come to light. A man named Frank Reiser has come into possession of a new specimen from the unusual 1876 phenomenon. We have an exclusive interview with Frank, and share the story of how he found it, what it means, and what we can learn from it. Also included in this episode is The Meatshower Part 1 - in case you missed it, or if you would like to listen again!</description>

His friend Francis "Frank" Johnson (1792-1844) was an equally influential musician.

<title>Walt and Dr. Mary</title>
<description>Walt Whitman was inspired after hearing Ralph Waldo Emerson speak, and self-published a book of poems he would continue updating for his entire life. When not writing poetry, he worked as a nurse during the Civil War, and published some unusual exercise advice. Dr. Mary Edwards Walker is the ONLY woman in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Her efforts during the Civil War were unmatched, but recognition has been hard to come by for her story.</description>

<title>Rail Tales</title>
<description>Episode 82 features the story of the Transcontinental Railroad, including the famous Golden Spike. Also in this episode is the story of Joseph Kekuku, a boy from Hawaii who changed music after being inspired by a random occurrence, possibly involving another railroad spike. If you'd like to learn more about Kekuku and the role of Hawaii in music through the steel guitar, I recommend the book Kika Kila, by John Troutman. It was very important to creating this episode.</description>

<title>Underwear Roundup with Benedict Arnold, Abram Spanel and the Playtex Space Suit</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/episode-75-underwear-roundup-with-benedict-arnold-abram-spanel-and-the-playtex-space-suit</link>
<description>Here's two more underwear stories that aren't in the the book I See Lincoln's Underpants (which is now available!) First Benedict Arnold betrays the American Army but gets caught thanks to something hiding in someone's underwear. Also When NASA planned to get someone to the moon, they needed a special Space Suit, and the only designers and makers up to the challenge had only made underwear for Playtex before the marvelous work of technology.</description>

<title>Underwear Chronicles Fourteen: Al Capone</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/underwear-chronicles-fourteen-al-capone</link>
<description>The last installment of The Underwear Chronicles - to celebrate the release of I See Lincoln's Underpants now available from booksellers! Al Capone grew up somewhere in the middle of a big family. Hand me downs were a way of life, so it makes sense that as an adult he was eager to have not just his own underpants, but his own fancy underpants. After arriving in Chicago from his native Brooklyn, he worked his way up to being the most powerful mob boss in town. He was famous all over the country, but he never really worried about going to jail.  In the end he brought down by some salesmen, including the man who sold him underwear.</description>

This episode traces the origin of the Faberge Eggs, and also the story of how it wound up in a kitchen in America’s Midwest. Also, as the Gold Rush boomed in the 1800s there were not enough actually, edible eggs to feed all the new faces in California.

<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/episode-72-rufus-vs-poe</link>
<description>Episode 72: Edgar Allan Poe is about as famous as an author can be, but that might be owed largely to Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Rufus didn't really like Poe and wrote a scathing obituary and biography on the man, creating the dark figure many of us think Poe to be. In addition the story of Poe and Rufus, Mick does a dramatic reading of "The Raven" a poem which made Edgar Allan Poe a literary superstar.</description>

When a Diphtheria epidemic threatens the small and far-off town of Nome Alaska, the only hope to get medicine to the sick is dogs.

<title>Underwear Chronicles Eight: Amelia Bloomer</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/underwear-chronicles-eight-amelia-bloomer</link>
<description>Despite being the namesake of an article of clothing that we commonly think of as underwear, Amelia Bloomer did not invent bloomers. To further the cause of Women’s Rights and to fight for the right to vote (in addition to prohibition), Amelia Bloomer ran a newspaper called The Lily.  When one of her friends showed up for a visit in a new outfit one day, history was made. Tired of the restrictive and oppressive clothing women were expected to wear in the 1800s, Amelia fell head over heels for the “tunic and pantalette combo,” as it was known. When she published the instructions to make them in The Lily, her subscriptions went through the roof.   Soon, the knee-length skirt and leg coverings underneath allowed for a new range of motion and freedom for women all over. One of the most remarkable things this allowed women to do was ride bicycles, which Susan B Anthony herself said, did “more to emancipate women than any one thing in the world.” Bloomers didn’t lead directly to the 19th Amendment, but the underwear played a strong supporting role.</description>

<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/episode-60-big-ideas-professor-tsc-lowe-and-john-cleves-symmes-jr</link>
<description>Professor TSC Lowe (who was not a professor at all) had visions for a transatlantic balloon flight. He never succeeded in that but he did wind up as the Chief Aeronaut of the Balloon Corps during the American Civil War. His vision laid the ground work for Ferdinand Von Zeppelin’s later accomplishments. John Cleves Symmes Jr. popularized a theory known as the Hollow Earth Theory. He believed that the earth was hollow and contained other habitable worlds. Was he right? He was worse than right. He was wrong. All music, as usual, by Mick Sullivan. The writing and voices too.</description>

<title>Episode 57: On Horseback!</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/episode-57-on-horseback</link>
<description>This episode tells the stories of Sibyl Ludington and Charley Willis. Sybil's well-known story is amazing, yet it lacks a lot of primary sources, and we use that as a way to introduce thinking about the past with a critical eye. No matter what Sibyl's story has inspired millions. Charley Willis was a cowboy, once enslaved in Texas, and who was impacted by the events of June 19th, or Juneteenth. After a lifetime on the trail, he left the world with one of the most well-known cowboy songs of all.</description>

<description>Django Reinhardt was a Romani musician who, despite losing the use of two of his fingers was one of the most important musicians of his time.

<description>Edwin Hubble changed our view of the Solar System, but he was also a collegiate National Champion basketball player and high school coach. He also dealt with the struggles of freezing his face to a telescope. Anything for Science! George Ellery Hale had the idea for the largest telescope in history, and the American Public made it a reality during the Great Depression. It was actually made from something you might use in the kitchen.</description>

<description>Levi Strauss left his native Germany to escape discrimination, and then left New York for the opportunities of the American West. He lost some gold, but changed the world with his pants partnership. Ferminia Sarras was a miner from Nicaragua who didn't wear jeans, but rather a black taffeta dress (in the desert sun). Her successes were many, and they even named a town after her.</description>

<title>Episode 53: Sophie And Willa</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/episode-53-sophie-and-willa</link>
<description>No one could have predicted that Sophie Blanchard would become France's leading aeronaut, but she flew higher than any woman before her. Willa Brown was the first Black woman to earn a pilot's license in America, but her accomplishments didn't end there. In many ways, she deserves credit for the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Also features Red Moon Road's song Sophie Blanchard 1778 (Official Aeronaut of the Empire and Restoration)</description>

<description>This episode is about places that used to be and which are now covered up by something new. Yarrow Mamout was an unusual man in early America, but the black business leader's story was literally buried by buildings near Washington DC. In the 2000s, his story came to light. Also, the Los Angeles communities of La Loma, Palo Verde, and Bishop were often grouped together under the name Chavez Ravine. The people of these communities were uprooted, and now Dodger stadium stands where they once lived.</description>

<title>Episode 41: OK BLOOMER!</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/episode-41-ok-bloomer</link>
<description>Amelia Bloomer helped change the world with a pair of underpants (which she didn't even invent). Among other things, it helped women ride bikes, and this led to a new independence in the late 1800's. Many women (even Susan B. Anthony) said the bike had more to to with women's independence than nearly anything else. So Melinda Beck is going to tell you her original telling of Tillie Anderson, a true life, turn-of-the-century bicycle racer ("scorchers" in the day) who might have been the fastest woman in America! Be sure to check out our Kids Listen Friends, including Timestorm and Girl Tales, for their Women's History episodes this month!</description>

Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de St. Georges, was a world class fencer, composer, conductor and musician who spent time in the royal courts of France and tutored Marie Antoinette. He was also the son of an enslaved woman. Ziryab is a mysterious man from medieval Spain, when Muslim culture dominated the area. He was a musician, scholar, and pioneer of food and fashion. Pretty much a rock star before rock stars were a thing. You'll hear Ms. Lynn from The Good Words Podcast and music from Mick Sullivan and Todd Armstrong. Episode written and produced by Mick Sullivan. Somebody give us a book deal already.</description>

Lily May Ledford and her band from Pinchem Tight Holler, KY (YEOW!!) play for President Roosevelt, First Lady Eleanor and the King and Queen of England. She almost hugs the queen.

<itunes:summary>The people of the late 1930's saw some fun music made by some remarkable women. Lily May Ledford and her band from Pinchem Tight Holler, KY (YEOW!!) play for President Roosevelt, First Lady Eleanor and the King and Queen of England. She almost hugs the queen. Clara Rockmore almost gives up music entirely until she meets Leon Theremin and literally writes the book on a new instrument. Featuring the voices of Julia Purcell, Mick Sullivan and sounds by Todd Hildreth.</itunes:summary>

<title>Bonus Episode: Ghost Ships! A Kids Listen Halloween Sweep</title>
<link>https://soundcloud.com/thepastandthecurious/halloween-sweeps-final</link>
<description>Have you heard of the Mary Celeste? If you've heard of a ghost ship, this is probably the one.  In 1872 it was found under sail in the Atlantic Ocean but with absolutely no one on board.  What gives? And was this completely unique?  It wasn't, but it is certainly the most famous case and we wanted to know more! Also featuring and original performance of one of our favorite songs "Devil and the Deep Blue Sea," written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler in 1932.  Mick Sullivan plays mandolin, guitar, banjo, washboard, bass harmonica and probably some other stuff too.</description>
